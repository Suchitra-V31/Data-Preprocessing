# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.It also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model.

It includes the following steps:

**1.Getting the dataset**

**2.Importing libraries**

**3.Importing datasets**

**4.Finding Missing Data**

**5.Encoding Categorical Data**

**6.Splitting dataset into training and test set**

**7.Feature scaling**

In this repository we will be analysing all these steps and get to know the implementation of them using PYTHON LIBRARIES.
